Mercedes Kart,7,"Sharon Cheng, Natalie Greenfield, Annie Ma, Brendon Matusch, Uche Ochuba ","MercedesKart is launching Waymate, a LLM/Vision-model-powered parking sign interpreter and road sign translator. It offers real time road sign translation from eight languages to the user’s preferred language. Sign translations and interpretations will be displayed on the heads-up display so the driver can keep their eyes on the road; for our prototype, we have implemented our system in an iPad app. Additionally, the app features automatic detection and interpretation of parking signs, informing users whether and for how long they can park based on the current time.

Waymate targets those driving in a place where they can’t read the native language. Although Google Maps can provide navigation instructions, being able to recognize physical signs adds another layer of confidence.

Krrish Chawla,8.a,Krrish Chawla,"The accurate identification and localization of signal sources is crucial in defense applications, as it enables airborne agents to make informed decisions and respond effectively to potential threats. However, the presence of noise in received signals and the computational constraints of airborne platforms pose significant challenges in achieving reliable signal denoising, classification, and direction of arrival estimation. My research presents a new approach for the same in airborne defense agents. The proposed system combines a lightweight CNN-LSTM classifier and a class-agnostic UNet-based diffusion model for denoising. The denoiser operates on a single timestep, effectively removing noise while preserving essential signal features. The denoised signal is then accurately classified, even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Further, the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm is employed for DOA estimation. The system offers a robust solution for signal identification and localization in defense applications, enhancing the capabilities of airborne agents in challenging environments.","Research, Security",Yes
Neural Compression for Satellite Imagery,9.a,Xiluo He,"In this project, we study the tradeoffs of compressing satellite imagery for machine learning performance. Whereas classic image compression methods are lossless, meaning that a compressed image – which we refer to as a representation – can be decompressed to the original state, we are instead interested in lossy image compression that preserves a notion of being “useful”. That is, we concede the ability to reconstruct the original image but require that for any downstream prediction task, we can achieve equal performance by training a predictor on the raw images versus on the compressed representations. Intuitively, we should expect algorithms for this definition of lossy compression to have a much higher compression rate than classic methods, since not all information required for decompression is useful for prediction. In fact, prior work suggests that a small subset of uncompressed information is required to maintain high performance of downstream classification tasks. ",Research,Yes

Panna Cotta,10.a,Santiago Hernandez,"Despite recent advances in computer science and artificial intelligence, personal data management has been traditionally overlooked. As consumers, Apple laptops ship out-of-the-box with a personal search tool, Spotlight. Nonetheless, it archaic, usually slow and mostly relies on classical search approaches like fuzzy and keyword search. This results in files being very difficult to find in one's device without the knowledge of their specific keywords or filenames.

In this Senior Project, I aim to explore the use of modern AI and statistical approaches, namely Large Language Models (LLMs), to design and implement a new information retrieval and search tool that makes efficient use of the most recent advances in the scientific community. Particularly, we think that it is possible to achieve low-latency search on files (in a ""personal"" domain) where the system can receive as input descriptive queries of the files and make that sufficient to find relevant files matching those query descriptions.",Research,Yes
Ashish Rao,10.b,Ashish Rao,"Continual Learning (CL) is a field of AI that studies the design of agents that can adapt to nonstationary streams of data. For example, CL-enabled recommendation systems might adapt to changing user preferences, anomaly detection systems might adapt to evolving conditions in the contexts in which they are deployed, and robots might adapt to changing hardware characteristics over time.

Besides being able to achieve high performance in nonstationary environments, CL agents should also be compute efficient. In this project, we attempt to design CL agents that can automatically increase or decrease their compute usage based on the complexity of the data they are processing. We present preliminary results exploring designs for compute adaptive agents, and find designs that achieve comparable or better performance to traditional CL agents while using ~10% fewer FLOPs on average.",Research,Yes
ExPLoRA,11.a,Medhanie Irgau,"Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques can adapt large pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks using only a fraction of the original trainable weights. An under-explored question of PEFT is in extending the pre-training phase without supervised labels. We introduce ExPLoRA, which improves transfer learning of pre-trained vision transformers (ViTs) under domain shifts. ExPLoRA continues the unsupervised pre-training objective on a new domain using pre-trained ViTs. In this extended pre-training phase, ExPLoRA unfreezes 1-2 pre-trained ViT blocks and all normalization layers, and then tunes all other layers with LoRA. We fine-tune the resulting model only with LoRA for supervised learning. We achieve SOTA results, outperforming pre-training and fine-tuning ViTs. We demonstrate a significant improvement in linear probing accuracy using a fraction of the parameters. Our ablation studies confirm the efficacy of our approach over other baselines.",Research,Yes
Emily Okabe,11.b,Emily Okabe,"We analyze the spread of misinformation online by comparing the effectiveness of factchecking sites in factchecking common narratives, finding the most important word features in narrative identification, and extending our findings to the multilingual setting. First, we compare the effectiveness of Twitter/X Community notes in mitigating the spread of misinformation by training a natural language inference model to determine whether a community note factchecks a tweet or not, then comparing Twitter/X's efficacy against factchecking sites in fact-checking misinformation narratives extracted using narrative clustering. Next, we find the most/least important tokens in identifying whether two passages have similar narratives to help determine which tokens should be given a greater weight in a semantic similarity model for downstream use in narrative clustering. Finally, we extend our study to multilingual news sources, identifying the most common narratives using clustering algorithms.","Research, Security",Yes

Stream of Search (SoS): Learning to Search in Language,13.b,Denise Hui Jean Lee,"Language models are rarely shown fruitful mistakes while training. They then struggle to look beyond the next token, suffering from a snowballing of errors and struggling to predict the consequence of their actions several steps ahead. In this paper, we show how language models can be taught to search by representing the process of search in language, as a flattened string — a stream of search (SoS). We propose a unified language for search that captures an array of different symbolic search strategies. We demonstrate our approach using the simple yet difficult game of Countdown, where the goal is to combine input numbers with arithmetic operations to reach a target number. We pretrain a transformer-based language model from scratch on a dataset of streams of search generated by heuristic solvers. We find that SoS pretraining increases search accuracy by 25% over models trained to predict only the optimal search trajectory. We further finetune this model with two policy improvement methods: Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). The finetuned SoS models solve 36% of previously unsolved problems, including problems that cannot be solved by any of the heuristic solvers. Our results indicate that language models can learn to solve problems via search, self-improve to flexibly use different search strategies, and potentially discover new ones. ",Research,Yes
"Classifying the Oceanographic Landscape of Palmyra Atoll: A Machine Learning Approach for High Resolution CTD Analysis",14.a,Chinmay Lalgudi,"Different oceanographic environments are known to exist around the world, from coral reefs in the tropics to deep ocean habitats in the Atlantic. Qualitatively, we can identify these regions, however there are no existing computational pipelines to quantitatively understand how oceanographic environments are different from one another.  We collected oceanographic profiles during a month-long cruise to Palmyra Atoll, and used temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll-a measurements as input in our models. We adapted Multivaraite Dynamic Time Warping to compare profiles of varying length, calculating the similarity distance between each of the profiles. We then applied unsupervised learning methods on this distance matrix, spatially visualizing these clusters on a map and deriving oceanographic and ecological conclusions. We ultimately present an unbiased computational framework for oceanographic classification in Palmyra Atoll, eventually generalizable to reef systems around the world.

It’s these candid, but genuine interactions that are representative of who we are truly interested in — not the person you swipe right on without much thought. Why then is it that these moments rarely lead to something real?

KERBY,6,"Katherine Chen, Esteban Wu, Ryan Kang, Will Fang, Yannie Tan","The Mercedes-Benz AI Palette is a set of immersive, entertainment-focused conversational AI personas that a driver can interact with.

Here's the user journey. Firstly, pick a persona. We've voice-cloned Peter Drury, Frank Sinatra, and David Attenborough for now to craft our three main personas: Football Commentator, Old Sport, and Art & Nature. Powered by GenAI, these personas engage in dialogue, react to events like honks and acceleration, and even react to hand gestures to provide persona-specific interactions. We emphasize the importance of immersiveness in our product to differentiate the experience from your typical, logistical AI assistant.

Built on the Android platform with conversational LLMs and text-to-speech synthesis, our models capture the distinct style, voice, and tone of each real-world figure, ensuring authentic conversations that make them sound natural, supportive, and humorous. The personas also react to honks and acceleration detected by sensors on a physical minicar. We've made sure to provide examples to personalize the unique features of each persona: the Football Commentator gives football news updates, Old Sport suggests new songs, and Art & Nature uses a real-time camera to respond to the driver's gestures and narrate surroundings using computer vision.",Automotive,Yes
