Financier,2,"Shawn Charles, Omar Ramos Escoto, Diego Zancaneli, Koren Gilbai, Tomas Pfeffer","Our product, Financier, extends the functionality of 13f.info which serves as a user-friendly platform to access SEC 13F filingsâ€”quarterly reports showcasing equity assets held by institutional investment managers. We build upon this existing framework by creating a generative AI model capable of analyzing these lengthy and monotonous reports into meaningful analysis. Financier aims to transform this basic utility into a dynamic analytical platform by integrating a GPT-like AI. This AI will allow users to interact with the tool using natural language queries, offering deeper insights and more granular analysis of hedge fund positions, changes, and performance metrics. By leveraging the existing data infrastructure of 13f.info and enhancing it with cutting-edge AI technology, our product will provide unprecedented access to sophisticated financial analysis that caters to both professional and casual investors.","AI, Finance",Yes

Relative Refresh,5,"Philip Baillargeon, Alyssa Koh, Amantina Rossi, Alissa Vuillier","Our team, in partnership with Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, supports NGOs creating upcycled products by assisting artisans in building their public profile, connecting with other upcycling partners, and sharing stories about their products. The goal of our platform is to â€œget more eyes on upcyclingâ€, which is rooted in our belief that consumer viable upcycled products are possible only as awareness of the upcycling process increases both among members of the public and within waste producing organizations. Our target user is NGO administrative staff who can use our web app to generate engaging content that can be attached to their products using QR codes and an upcycling-centered public profile page that helps connect waste suppliers with producers of upcycled products.","Social Media, Environment",Social Media
