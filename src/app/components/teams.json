However, the presence of noise in received signals and the computational constraints of airborne platforms pose significant challenges in achieving reliable signal denoising, classification, and direction of arrival estimation. My research presents a new approach for the same in airborne defense agents. The proposed system combines a lightweight CNN-LSTM classifier and a class-agnostic UNet-based diffusion model for denoising. The denoiser operates on a single timestep, effectively removing noise while preserving essential signal features. The denoised signal is then accurately classified, even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Further, the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm is employed for DOA estimation. The system offers a robust solution for signal identification and localization in defense applications, enhancing the capabilities of airborne agents in challenging environments.",

Whereas classic image compression methods are lossless, meaning that a compressed image \u2013 which we refer to as a representation \u2013 can be decompressed to the original state, we are instead interested in lossy image compression that preserves a notion of being \u201cuseful\u201d. That is, we concede the ability to reconstruct the original image but require that for any downstream prediction task, we can achieve equal performance by training a predictor on the raw images versus on the compressed representations. Intuitively, we should expect algorithms for this definition of lossy compression to have a much higher compression rate than classic methods, since not all information required for decompression is useful for prediction. In fact, prior work suggests that a small subset of uncompressed information is required to maintain high performance of downstream classification tasks. ",

We fine-tune the resulting model only with LoRA for supervised learning. We achieve SOTA results, outperforming pre-training and fine-tuning ViTs.

They then struggle to look beyond the next token, suffering from a snowballing of errors and struggling to predict the consequence of their actions several steps ahead. In this paper, we show how language models can be taught to search by representing the process of search in language, as a flattened string \u2014 a stream of search (SoS). We propose a unified language for search that captures an array of different symbolic search strategies. We demonstrate our approach using the simple yet difficult game of Countdown, where the goal is to combine input numbers with arithmetic operations to reach a target number. We pretrain a transformer-based language model from scratch on a dataset of streams of search generated by heuristic solvers. We find that SoS pretraining increases search accuracy by 25% over models trained to predict only the optimal search trajectory. We further finetune this model with two policy improvement methods: Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). The finetuned SoS models solve 36% of previously unsolved problems, including problems that cannot be solved by any of the heuristic solvers. Our results indicate that language models can learn to solve problems via search, self-improve to flexibly use different search strategies, and potentially discover new ones. ",

We adapted Multivaraite Dynamic Time Warping to compare profiles of varying length, calculating the similarity distance between each of the profiles. We then applied unsupervised learning methods on this distance matrix, spatially visualizing these clusters on a map and deriving oceanographic and ecological conclusions. We ultimately present an unbiased computational framework for oceanographic classification in Palmyra Atoll, eventually generalizable to reef systems around the world.\n",
